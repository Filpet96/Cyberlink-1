### The news feed author items should contain the following data:
- ID
- Full name
- Both the authors and the news feed items should be stored in Arrays in a structure that's simple to use in your code and that's easily understandable. The authors and news feed items don't have to be within the same Array, but some sort of connection should exist between a news feed item and it's author. Never the less the news feed items should be ordered based on the published date, so the latest news feed item should go on top and vice versa.
